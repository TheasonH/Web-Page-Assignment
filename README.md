How does it look to you? Did you type it all out? Remember, if it seems like a hassle
to type out the examples, you can find all the markup in the code archive, as I ex
plained in the preface. However, bear in mind that simply copying and pasting
markup, then saving and running it, doesn’t really give you a feel for creating your
own web site—it really will pay to learn by doing. Even if you make mistakes, it’s
still a better way to learn (you’ll be pleased when you can spot and fix your own

<h2>Welcome to our super-dooper Scuba site</h2>
<p>Glad you could drop in and share some air with us! You've

<h3>About Us</h3>
<p>Bubble Under is a group of diving enthusiasts based in the
south-west UK who meet up for diving trips in the summer
months when the weather is good and the bacon rolls are
flowing. We arrange weekends away as small groups to cut the
costs of accommodation and travel and to ensure that everyone
gets a trustworthy dive buddy.</p>
<p>Although we're based in the south-west, we don't stay on our
own turf: past diving weekends away have included trips up to
Scapa Flow in Scotland and to Malta's numerous wreck
sites.</p>
<p>When we're not diving, we often meet up in a local pub
to talk about our recent adventures (any excuse, eh?).</p>
<h3>Contact Us</h3>
<p>To find out more, contact Club Secretary Bob Dobalina on
01793 641207 or email bob@bubbleunder.com.</p>
